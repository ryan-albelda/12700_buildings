Semester Project for Autonomous Sustainable Buildings: From Theory to Practice

The thermal response time of a space plays a critical role in determining how quickly occupants can access to comfort and 
how sustainably they can do so. This project introduces _comfo_, a decision-support system that measures or estimates the 
thermal time constant (τ) of a room, categorizes it as fast, medium, or slow, and then provides comfort recommendations 
tailored to theroom’s responsiveness. τ is either directly sensed via temperature logging or estimated from postal code, 
building age, and seasonal weather assumptions. These categorizations feed into a decision tree algorithm that generates 
both low-carbon and standard comfort strategies, while simulating the time and energy impact of each. Comfo's innovation 
lies in using interpretablethermal physics to inform user-facing, real-time comfort guidance and supporting sustainability 
without sacrificing personalization. Tested in a residential setting, Confo demonstrates howtime-aware comfort adaptation 
can lead to more energy-aware occupant behavior.
